on your local machine.

## 1. Introduction
The To-Do List project is a simple web application that allows users 
to create and manage their to-do tasks. 
As a student project, the main aim was to practice and demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript

Filter tasks based on their completion status.
Persistence: The tasks are stored in a database and retrieved on subsequent visits.

## 3. Technologies Used
The project primarily relies on the following technologies:

JavaScript: Used for the client-side logic and interaction.
Node.js: Powers the server-side functionality, handles HTTP requests, and manages data storage.
Express.js: A Node.js framework used to build the server and handle routing.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and retrieve task data.
